# Simon-Game

 Simon Memorize Online, has four colored buttons -green, yellow, red and blue- and each color makes a different sound when clicked on. The playerâ€™s goal is to recreate the order in which the game presses the buttons and as the game progresses the number of buttons to be pressed increases. It creates a challenge for the player who will look for their self-improvement each time they play, wanting to reach a higher score on the next game. Simon Memorize Online is aimed to improve concentration and increase their attention capacity, as well as the observation skills. As they need to retain a color and a sound each time and repeat it in order again and again, their memory will have to work hard.
